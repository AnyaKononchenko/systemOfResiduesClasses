SRC stands for the System of Residues Classes and is used for representation of the non-positional notation. SRC allows implementation of the modular arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction and multiplication. Its main features are:
- independance of remainders;
- equality of remainders;
- small capacity of remainers. 

These features allow us to provide a desirable reliability level of a targeted system, which is one of the most basic requirements to the modern real-time information handling systems.
